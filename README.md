# Automated-Scientific-Data-Paper-Linkage-with-Contextual-Summarization
This project focuses on building an AI-driven system that automatically links scientific datasets with their corresponding research publications and generates context-aware summaries. The goal is to enhance data discoverability, reproducibility, and understanding across scientific disciplines.
Key Features

Data-Paper Linkage: Automatically identifies and connects datasets with relevant scientific papers using metadata, citation networks, and textual similarity.

Contextual Summarization: Generates concise, domain-aware summaries explaining how datasets are used and interpreted in papers.

Semantic Understanding: Utilizes transformer-based NLP models (e.g., BERT, SciBERT) for entity recognition, contextual embedding, and document similarity.

Automation Pipeline: End-to-end workflow for ingesting research papers, extracting dataset mentions, linking with repositories, and producing summaries.

Evaluation Metrics: Includes performance benchmarking using precision, recall, F1-score, and human-evaluated summary quality.
